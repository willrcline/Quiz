## file structure:
Broken up into 4 js files
* Main: Initiates things and creates globalVars object
* Utils: random functions
* Handlers: event handlers from some of the button presses
* Views: create, decorate, append elements

Code is written entirely in vanilla JS

HTML contains 3 tags within the body:
* Header: has a "view highscores" link and has the timer count
* Main: has quiz questions
* Div (#is-answer-correct): has text inserted into it for a few seconds after user submits an answer
